How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    
	It compares both the files and list out only the differences which might help in seeing the bugs which were introduced in the newer version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because it would be easy to go back to different versions to trace out any bugs or restore them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Choosing to commit manually has pros like flexibility which makes the commit right size when compared to google docs and has cons like the decision when to make a commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git has a concept called repository in which it keeps track of multiple files where as google docs has only one file.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log lists all the commits made to that repository and git diff helps identify the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    We can revert to previous version easily if the current version breaks the functionality.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to use it when working on a project
